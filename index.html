            Night School is a week-long interdisciplinary workshop hosted by the Yale Graphic Design department, which
            brings a lineup of guest artists, theorists and researchers to work together with students in the programme.
            Night School sessions create a space for multi-level engagements between the cohorts around critical, timely
            issues, developing meaningful discourse between students and faculty and an acknowledgment of each of our
            humanity as it relates to contexts beyond the walls of the department. Some of this already happens through
            our courses but there is a need for a focused effort, especially in light changes within the United States
            and globally that have affected legislation, the environment, global economies and the movement of people.
            This semester’s Night School is designed in conversation with the exhibition, ‘Survival in the 21st
            Century’, organized and curated by Georg Diez, Nicolaus Schafhausen and set for presentation 2024 at
            Deichtorhallen Hamburg in Germany. One part of this project in Hamburg is The School of Survival which will
            form a central part of the exhibition, an emancipatory and learning space, arranged around for kinds of
            practices: Local practice, Democratic practice, Transformative practice, Planetary practice.

            Night School is a week-long interdisciplinary workshop hosted by the Yale Graphic Design department, which
            brings a lineup of guest artists, theorists and researchers to work together with students in the programme.
            Night School sessions create a space for multi-level engagements between the cohorts around critical, timely
            issues, developing meaningful discourse between students and faculty and an acknowledgment of each of our
            humanity as it relates to contexts beyond the walls of the department. Some of this already happens through
            our courses but there is a need for a focused effort, especially in light changes within the United States
            and globally that have affected legislation, the environment, global economies and the movement of people.
            This semester’s Night School is designed in conversation with the exhibition, ‘Survival in the 21st
            Century’, organized and curated by Georg Diez, Nicolaus Schafhausen and set for presentation 2024 at
            Deichtorhallen Hamburg in Germany. One part of this project in Hamburg is The School of Survival which will
            form a central part of the exhibition, an emancipatory and learning space, arranged around for kinds of
            practices: Local practice, Democratic practice, Transformative practice, Planetary practice.
